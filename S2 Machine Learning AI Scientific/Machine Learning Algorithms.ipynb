    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in modern history, claiming the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew. Beyond its historical significance, this tragedy exposed systemic gaps in maritime safety regulations, leading to major reforms. Factors such as gender, age, socioeconomic status, and ticket fare played critical roles in determining ones survival outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I aim to explore the Kaggle Titanic dataset and utilise machine learning models to predict passenger survival. Through data analysis and supervised learning techniques, my goal is to identify key features influencing survival rate, compare and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models, and draw conclusions into the factors that contributed survival possibilities.

    "To gain deeper insights, it’s important to investigate how various features of the dataset influenced the survival rate.

By analysing these features, we can uncover potential patterns or trends that contributed to survival.\n",

    "Upon exploring the dataset using info() and describe(), it is evident that the Titanic dataset consists of 12 columns and 891 rows, with a mix of numerical and categorical features. Key features include Sex, Pclass, Age, Fare, and Embarked, while the target variable, Survived, indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0). A closer look reveals some missing data, with the Age column containing 177 missing values, the Cabin column having a significant number of missing entries (only 204 non-null values), and Embarked missing just 2 values. This highlights the need for data cleaning and imputation.\n",

    "From the summary statistics, we observe that the average passenger age is around 29.7 years, ranging from a minimum of 0.42 years (likely a baby) to a maximum of 80 years. The Fare column exhibits high variability, with an average fare of 32.20 and a maximum fare of 512.33, suggesting potential correlations between ticket price, class, and survival. Most passengers had no siblings, spouses, parents, or children aboard, as indicated by the median values of 0 for both SibSp and Parch.\n",

    "These observations set the stage for the next steps, which include handling missing values in Age and Embarked, potentially dropping or engineering features from Cabin, and exploring how key features like Sex, Pclass, and Fare influence survival outcomes."
